# Slay the Spire Clone: Project Plan

## Core Concept
A deck-building roguelike inspired by Slay the Spire, but with unique classes, cards, and artifacts. The visual theme will be based on the MTG-style card art generated by nano-banana.

## Feature Roadmap
- [ ] **Title Screen:** A simple screen with a "Start Game" button.
- [ ] **Classes:** At least two distinct character classes with unique starting decks.
- [ ] **Map Progression:** A branching map of nodes (combat, elite, rest, unknown).
- [ ] **Combat System:** Turn-based combat with player hand, energy, and card effects.
- [ ] **Card Upgrades:** A system for improving cards.
- [ ] **Artifacts (Relics):** Passive items that grant special abilities.
